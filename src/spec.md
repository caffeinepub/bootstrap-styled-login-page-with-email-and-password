# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a dedicated Bootstrap-styled login page UI with email/password inputs and a submit button, using a warm neutral, centered card theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a login page that renders a Bootstrap-styled form with Email (type=email), Password (type=password), and a primary “Log in” submit button.
- Include/load Bootstrap CSS in the frontend so Bootstrap styling works at runtime without manual CSS setup.
- Apply a consistent warm neutral visual theme (non blue/purple), with centered card layout, consistent spacing, and typography.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a login page that shows a centered, Bootstrap-styled login card with email and password fields and a “Log in” button, presented with a warm neutral look and feel.
