  "summary": "REQ-1/2/3 appear implemented: a dedicated Bootstrap-styled login form page with email/password inputs and a submit button exists, Bootstrap CSS is loaded via CDN in the HTML entry point, and the page uses a centered card layout with a warm neutral theme. However, the diff introduces multiple unrequested/auth-related hook files (and a backend actor stub) and appears to violate the constraint about not editing certain existing hook/main files by adding new content under those restricted paths.",
